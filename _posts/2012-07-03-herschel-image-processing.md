Previously I had posted about [my entries for the Hubble Hidden Treasures Contest](/astronomy/2012/06/10/my-entries-for-the-hubble-hidden-treasures-image-processing-contest.html) but there are far more datasets available online than just Hubble.

After all the fun I had processing the Hubble images, I decided to try my hand at processing a few images from the [Herschel Space Observatory](http://sci.esa.int/herschel/), which is operated by the European Space Agency. 

Herschel is used for capturing images in the far infra-red and submillimetre range of the spectrum, and thus gives very different views than what Hubble can give. Similarly to Hubble, these images are stored in a [searchable archive](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/herschel/science-archive) available for the public, and the process involved in processing the Hubble images is very similar, with images taken in different wavelengths can be combined into a colour image after processing.

Below is a gallery of images I created out of this archive.
