I have been learning to play violin for a little over 2 years now, and have been focusing on the fundamentals with a bit of venturing into folk styles. For myself, I do find the folk styles, especially Irish traditional music, more fun to play than classical. As an adult starter, I also find the folk tunes more accessible than the classical repertoire.

Anyay, while learning, I have tried to collect folk tunes online, but managing the tunes has become a bit of a problem. I started searching for a decent Android app that could act as my music library, so I could have the music on my phne, or a tablet. Not finding a solution I liked, I decided to build my own.

Thus was born *The Folk Tune Library*. This Android app has a built-in library of over 2200 public domain folk tunes from around the world.

The following features are available in the app:
* Each tune can be rendered as sheet music or ABC notation.
* Play back the tune, using one of several instruments
* Transpose a tune to any key up or down a full octave.
* Share the tune as ABC notation, or sheet music in PNG or SVG formats.
* Add songs to user-created lists
* Add custom tunes directly by entering the ABC notation
* Import songs from ABC tune books
* Export list of songs to ABC tune book
* Add tunes to the library by searching several ABC notation websites on the internet

The Folk Tune Library is now available on the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magnaursa.folktunelibrary).
