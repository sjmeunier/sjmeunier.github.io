Sunday afternoon we had to say good bye to our beloved Noisette, who slipped away in our arms.

She was fine the day before and even enjoyed her long walk to the heath, but that night began to look ill and in the morning we took her to the emergency vet who told us she had a large mass on her spleen or liver causing abdominal bleeding. Our only options were risky surgery likely to kill her or to put her down..

With her age and her other health issues, such as her diabetes, we really only had one option.

I was going through our photos of Noisette, and put together this tribute video with some of my favourites.

I miss her presence around the house immensely. She was the best dog in the entire world.
