I took a few images of the moon at first quarter, on th 15th March 2016, with Mare Serenitatis and Mare Crisium being very prominent. I  combined the seperate images into one large composite of the moon.

I was unable to get enough images to complete the moon before it disappeared behind my roof ;).
