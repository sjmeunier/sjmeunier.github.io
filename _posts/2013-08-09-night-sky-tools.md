I have finally started uploading apps to the Android app store. The three apps I previously wrote about (Scientific Name Search, Plasmatic and Dutch Public Holidays) are uploaded to the app store, as well as a few apps I created based on a version of my astronomical library ported to Java.

The crowning glory of these astronomical apps I have uploaded to the app store is Night Sky Tools ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smeunier.nightskytools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smeunier.nightskytools)).

The features included in the app are:
* Angular separation
* Astronomical Time
* Atmospheric refraction
* Coordinate convertor
* Eclipses
* Magnitude
* Precession
* Conjunctions and Oppositions
* Ephemerides of the planets, sun and moon
* Equinoxes
* Positions of Jupiterâ€™s moons
* Planetary orbits
* Constellations
* Stellar Classification
* Telescope Airy Disc
* Telescope F-Ratio
* Telescope Magnification

Go ahead and check out the app.

_UPDATE - Feb 2016: Since the original post date, I have subsequently sold this app, therefore am no longer responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the app_
