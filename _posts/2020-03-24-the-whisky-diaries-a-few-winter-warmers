It has been a while since I posted some whisky updates. Over the last winter, I have enjoyed a few new whiskies, while enjoying relaxed evenings out with my wife. It will probably be a while before this happens again, due to the lockdowns with the Corona virus.

### Scapa Skiren Single Malt
From the Orkney islands, this oak-aged whisky had a gentle alluring nose with hints of fresh citrus, follwoed by a fruity aftertaste with a bit of a herby note. It as silky smooth, and enjoyed it very much.

### Aberfeldy 12 Year Old Single Malt
Hailing from Perthshire, the Aberfeldy was immensely enjoyable, with a fruity taste with dashes of spiced honey. This was a perfect whisky to sip while relaxing on a terrace during the evening, watching the people going by.

### Yellow Spot 12 Year Old Single Pot
This one is the only Irish whiskey on this list, and it delivered. It had a fresh sharpness to it, following by a soothing and warm draw.

### Chivas Regal 18 Year Old Blend
Normally, I tend to favour the single malts, however, this old classic is exceptional. The taste was reminiscent of bitter fuge with vanilla, with a woody palate. It is definitely on my favourites list.

### Oban West 14 Year Old Single Malt
I have left one of the best for last. This West Highland whisky has a gentle sweet citrus flavour underlying a woody and peaty richness. All of the above whiskies were great, but this one stood out for me.
