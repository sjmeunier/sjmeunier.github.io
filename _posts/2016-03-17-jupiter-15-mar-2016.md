Last night's pic of Jupiter.

This is the first colour image I have taken so far with my new equipment. This image comprises three video exposures of Jupiter, using R,G and B filters for each video, and then stacking the frames and merging the 3 resulting images.

The seeing was not great and clouds came over before I could get a decent amount of frames recorded, but turned out not too badly anyway.
