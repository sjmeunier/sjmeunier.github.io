NGC 1763, also known as LHA 120-N 11B and ESO 85-EN20, is an an emission nebula with an associated cluster of stars in the Large Megallanic Cloud, in the constellation of Dorado.

For the image below, I used two sets of SuperMosaic images from the Spitzer Infrared space observatory.

A SuperMosaic is one of the types of products made available by the Spitzer Legacy Archive, consisting of a composite of various individual images taken directly by Spizter and stitched together into one large image. A set of SuperMosaics, will contain composite images of each of the bandwidths taken.

Each SuperMosaic set comprised of four images, taken with the IRAC instrument, with filters in the 3.5, 4.5, 5.7 and 7.8 Î¼m bands.

After applying artificial colouring to each image corresponding to a wavelength band, I then stiched the two resulting images into one large final picture.

The image does not include the entire nebula, but does include a few interesting features.
