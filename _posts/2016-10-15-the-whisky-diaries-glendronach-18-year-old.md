The Glendronach 18 year old Allardice Highland single malt. matured in Oloroso sherry casks, is a smooth and complex whisky, and I rank as my favourite bottle in my collection.

The Glendronach has a sweet and smooth palate, bursting with sherry and fruity flavours, and a hint of smokiness, with a long satisfying finish. 

With an alcohol content of 46%, you have a good strong whisky but does not feel overpowering.

When this bottle is finished, it is certainly one whisky I will have to restock up on.
