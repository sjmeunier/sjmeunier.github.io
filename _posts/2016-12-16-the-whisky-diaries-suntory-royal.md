Everyone knows that the best whisky comes from Scotland, Ireland and the USA, but there **are** other places that produce some excellent stuff. 

Surprisingly, Japan is home to whisky that is very reminiscent of Scotland, and just as good! The Japanese whisky industry was inspired by Scotland, and the results are almost indistinguishable

I received a bottle of Suntory Royal Blend form a friend who had visited Japan, and it is one of the superior blends which I have tried. It is amazingly smooth with subtle flavours. It is very easy drinking.

It is a good whisky from the most unlikely of places.
