A few months ago, I wrote a [post](https://sjmeunier.github.io/programming/2016/11/06/family-tree-visualisation-with-unity3d.html) about the family tree visualisation app I wrote using Unity, and followed up with the [live web demo](https://sjmeunier.github.io/AncestryWeb3D/).

The app used to show the 3D visualisation of the ancestry of a selected individual, based on an imported Gedcom file. This is still the main mode for the application, but have now also added a dual tree mode, which shows the visualisation of two root indivuals side by side. Shared ancestors are grouped together in a subtree, allowing you to easily visualise common ancestry between two people.

For more information about the app, I recommend reading my [original post](https://sjmeunier.github.io/programming/2016/11/06/family-tree-visualisation-with-unity3d.html).

The full source code is available at [https://github.com/sjmeunier/ancestry-web-3d](https://github.com/sjmeunier/ancestry-web-3d).
