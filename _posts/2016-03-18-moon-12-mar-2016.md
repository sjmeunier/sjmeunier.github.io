I reprocessed my combined image of 4 images I took of the moon on the 12th of March 2016 to clean it up a bit.

The high-resolution portion of the image below is my pics I took of the moon, combined with a lower resolution pic of the moon to fill in the area I was unable to take.

The moon was at first quarter.
