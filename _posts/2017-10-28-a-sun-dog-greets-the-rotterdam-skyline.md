Yesterday, I was giving my in-laws a tour of Rotterdam, and while waiting for the harbour cruise, around 10 to 10 in the morning, I was treated to a sun dog peaking out between two of the skyscrapers on the Rotterdam skyline. The sun dog is the large bright spot between the two right-most skyscrapers in the image. The shot was taken from the quai, alongside the Erasmus bridge, looking across the Nieuwe Mass river. The weather was alternating between sunny skies and rain all day, and the sun dog lasted less than a minute before disappearing with the rapidly changing weather conditions.

Due to the short duration of the sun dog, I did not have time to get more than a quick snap of the event with my Samsung S7.

Since I posted only a few weeks ago about sun dogs, you can read more about them in that [post](/astronomy/2017/08/08/sun-dogs-in-a-summer-sky.html), or on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog).
