I have now had a chance to process my image of the Mercury transit I took earlier this evening. I improved the contrast and made some other tweaks to get a decent image. This really highlights Mercury (near the centre bottom of the image) with a few sunspots visible.

Taken at 18:55 on 9 May 2016.

_The image was taken with my Meade 4.5" telescope (untracked) and 32mm eyepiece, projected onto a piece of paper, and then photographed with my Samsung S6_
