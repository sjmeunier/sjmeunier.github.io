The [PC-GPE](http://www.qzx.com/pc-gpe/), or to give it its full name, the PC Game Programmer's Encyclopedia is ancient. I can remember treasuring my copy of it I had way back in high school, and I had thought that it had disappeared.

The PC-GPE is a comprehensive collection of articles on how to program various bits of hardware with particular emphasis on games. So things like how to program a VGA card, or joystick are covered.

Most of the hardware covered would appear archaic by today's standards, but it was a classic in its day, and still has useful nuggets in there.
