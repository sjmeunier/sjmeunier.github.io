The Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old is one of those very drinkable whiskies. Ut uas the sweet flavours reminiscent of toffee, custard and honey, with a bit of smokiness adding some depth.

With some of the malty flavours, it makes me think a little about the Belgian ales, which I also love.

Altogether, this is an outstanding whisky, and would not complain it ended up in my Christmas stocking.
