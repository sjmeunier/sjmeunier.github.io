So, after several years of letting my previous blog die, I am reviving it here on GitHub Pages. 

This blog will focus on my myriad of hobby development projects, as well as my other interests, such as astronomy and genealogy.
I also intent to revive some of my favourite posts from my old blog, and repost them here over time.

Watch this space!
