A few days ago, my wife and one of her friends spent the afternoon catching up over a drink. After work, I joined them for a bit, and, without much convincing, thought I would get a whisky. This time I tried a Talisker Skye.

Talisker is the only distillery on the Isle of Skye, from which this whisky gets its name. The name of the distillery comes from the old Norse name *Thalas Gair*, meaning *Sloping Rock*. The wild and rugged, Isle of Skye, is the largest island in the Inner Hebrides.

Taking a sip, I got a strong initial bite - a little fruity, but predominated by a sweet and peppery taste, followed by a velvety smooth feel and lingering smoke. The smokiness is a good balance - not too subtle and certainly not overpowering.

Overall, I thought it was an easy-drinking whisky. It lacks the complexity of some of my favourites, but is something I can kick back and enjoy.
