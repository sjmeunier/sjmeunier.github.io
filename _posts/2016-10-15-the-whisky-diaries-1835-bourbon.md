The 1835 Bourbon was the first whisky my brother and I tried when he came to visit this last week. It is the only American Bourbon I have in my collection, given to me by an ex of a friend of my wife and I. Normally I don't drink much Bourbon, usually preferring Scottish single malts, but this bottle is delicious.

The 1835 has a rather sweet smooth flavour, and it drank well. The sweetness was not too strong, compared to other Bourbons I have had in the past.

I would not have picked this bottle as my first choice, but having tried it, it has a deserved place in my collection.
