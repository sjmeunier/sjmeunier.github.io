With my brother's visit, he brought along a box of Whisky tasters from the Kilbeggan distillery. Each of these whiskies had a very distinctive taste.

## Kilbeggan Blend
The first whisky we tried of this batch was the Kilbeggan blend of malt and grain whiskies. The flavour was light and sweet, and being rather mild, it tasted pretty generic to me. It had not much complexity and would probably be suited for mixing. There was nothing bad in the flavour, and was quite drinkable, but there wasn't much to it.

## Tyrconnell Single Malt
Next on the list was the Tyrconnell Single Malt. This whisky was quite a bit stronger in flavour and had a distinctive fruity taste. It was one of the drier whiskies we had. Overall it was an enjoyable drink.

## Kilbeggan 8 Year Old Single Grain
The Kilbeggan 8 Year Old was, by far, the best Irish whisky we had tasted on my brother's visit. Being a single grain, the flavour profile was very different to most whiskies, and had a very sweet, smooth and accessible feel to it. It drank very well. 

## Connamara Single Malt
The last Irish whisky on our menu was the Connamara. The flavour of htis whisky was like none other I had tasted. It was peaty but with a completely different flavour profile to the peaty Scotch whisky that I love so much. The taste was more reminiscent of a sooty chimney than a pleasant smokey hit. This is not a whisky I would try again soon.
