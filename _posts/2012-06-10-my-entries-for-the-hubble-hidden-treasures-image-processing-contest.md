The Hubble Space Telescope has taken many awesome shots of the universe, but many of them have only ever been seen by scientists. This is why the Hubble Legacy Archive and European Space Agency announced the [Hubble Hidden Treasures Image Processing Contest](https://www.spacetelescope.org/projects/hiddentreasures/contest/).

The purpose of the contest was for the public to browse the Hubble Legacy Archive, which contains all the data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, which is freely available to the public, and find great images never before published to the public. 

The raw images required a fair amount of processing. Black-and-white images are available in various wavelengths for many objects. These first need to have the brightness and contrast adjusted and then have a colour filter applied. Once this is done, the separate images can be combined into a colour image.

For the competition, over the last several months, I have managed to process 101 images which I submitted to the competition. You can view the full album on Flickr by clicking on the slideshow below.

I didn't win anything, but it was a lot of fun to do.
