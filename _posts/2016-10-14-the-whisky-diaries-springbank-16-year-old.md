The same night my brother and I tried the Macallan 12 year old, we also had some Springbank 16 Year Old. 

My bottle of Springbank is bottled as part of the Adelphi Collection, and with alchohol content of 53.9%, is the strongest whisky in my collection.

The Springbank is a Campbeltown single malt Scoth whisky aged in sherry casks, and it packs a huge punch. It has a very smoky palate with a rough powerful peaty flavour. It started out tasting more nutty, but quickly hits you with the smokiness. The flavour is complex, and I enjoyed it, but it was not my brother's cup of tea. He compared it to drinking kerosene.

Overall, it is a very good complex whisky but is not for the faint-hearted.
