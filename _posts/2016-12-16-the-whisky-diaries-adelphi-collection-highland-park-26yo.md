The Highland Park 26 Year Old Single Malt is an excellent whisky. The balance of flavour is incredible. It has peatiness but not too much. It is dry, but not too dry. It fruity and woody notes. Overall, it feels like dozens of distinct flavours all complimenting each other, while at hte same time being amazingly smooth, and even with a relatively high alchohol content of 47%, it feels less harsh than most other whiskies.

The Highland Park ranks as one of my all-time favourite whiskies.
