Aged in oak casks for 12 years, the Glenfiddich 12 Year Old is one of those classic whiskies.

It has an emininently smooth profile, with spicy and floral notes.

While this is a good whisky - and I do enjoy drinking it - for me, this whisky seems a little generic. I miss some of the complexity that I have grown used to in some of the other whiskies in my collection.
