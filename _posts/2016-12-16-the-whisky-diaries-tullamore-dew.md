My brother came over for a visit and brought along a few tasters of Irish Whisky. Normally, we enjoy Scotch together, but with him having moved to Ireland recently, we thought we would try a few Irish samples. The first distillery on our list was the Tullamore Dew.

##Tullamore Dew Blend
The Tullamore Dew Blend was the first bottle we tried. It is a very smooth whisky and good for enjoying socially.

##Tullamore Dew Special Reserve 12 Year Old
Next we tried the Special Reserve 12 Year Old. It is a blend of pot still, malt and grain whiskies, and has a rich bold caramelly palette, with some woody notes from the casks. Overall it was a relatively enjoyable bottle.

##Tullamore Dew 12 Year Old Single Malt Limited Edition
I had noticed a general trend of the Irish whiskies to have a softer note to them than their Scotch counterparts in general, but the Tullamore Dew 12 Year Old Single Malt reminded me much more of Scotch whisky than the Irish we had been sampling.

Matured in Oloroso Sherry casks, this whisky packs more of a punch. It hits you hard but follows by a lingering smoothness. It is a fairly sweet fruity whisky, with the sherry flavouring coming through well.
