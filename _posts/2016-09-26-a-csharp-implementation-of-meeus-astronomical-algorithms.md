One of the standard books of algorithms for astronomical calculations is the book [_Astronomical Algorithms_ by Jean Meeus](https://www.amazon.com/Astronomical-Algorithms-Jean-Meeus/dp/0943396611). This book was first published in 1991, and is considered on of _the_ references. It covers everything from celestial coordinate conversions, planetary positions, calendar conversions, binary star positions, eclipses, conjunctions, and much, much more.

I made extensive use of the algorithms in the book when I was busy implementing Night Sky Tools, a comprehensive astronomy app on Android, using Java. I no longer mantain that app, having sold it, but still find astronomical calculations fascinating. 

That is why I was delighted to discover a comprehensive C&#35; implementation of the algorithms from the book on Github by [Joe Sauve](https://github.com/jsauve/AASharp). The project was last updated 5 years ago, but appears complete. I am pretty certain that I may find a use for this project in the future.
