Noisette, our dog, has now been in the Netherlands for 2 and a half months, and has settled in quite nicely. She is enjoying discovering the new smells, new parks, and the new dogs.

There is a strange thing that happens every night though.

In the evenings, Noisette’s favourite thing to do is to snuggle up under her blanket on “her” chair and doze off, experiencing the occasional doggie dream along way.

Each night though, between 9 and 10pm, she wakes up from her sleep, dashes to the window and starts barking, and going crazy. The object of her excitement – a small grey dog (I think a Bishon).

The curious thing about this all, is that this particular dog is the only dog she ever does this for, despite there being quite a few dogs that go walking down our street. In addition to this she has never actually met this dog face to face.

Most nights, she is also at the window barking, while the dog is still a block away from our house, and not once have I ever actually heard any noise from the dog or its owner. The only way I know they are walking past is because Noisette goes so mad.

So then, why on earth does Noisette dislike this particular dog so much? And how does she know when this dog is coming past? Does she hear or smell something that I don’t?

I can’t answer any of these questions, but I do get time every night to ponder them.
