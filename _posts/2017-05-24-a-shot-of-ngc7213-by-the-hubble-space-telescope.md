It has been a while since I did some image processing from the [Hubble Legacy Archive](https://hla.stsci.edu/), and while searching around a bit, I found this little gem.

NGC 2713 is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Grus, with some rather prominent dust lanes visible. It has an apparent magnitude of 9.7, and apparent size of 3.1' x 2.8'.

The image is a composite of two raw images taken in the 555 (green) and 814 (infrared) wavelengths taken with the WFPC2 camera.
