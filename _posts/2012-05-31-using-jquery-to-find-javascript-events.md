One of the most frustrating things about JavaScript is being able to determine what events are being fired for a particular element, especially in a complex web application where a single element might have several different functions attached to a particular event.

Well, jQuery comes to the rescue.

jQuery has a very useful, and rather unknown, method to return all the events attached to an element, which is particularly useful when used in the web browserâ€™s console while debugging a web page.

All this needs is one single line of code, and hey presto!

{% highlight javascript %}
$(element).data('events');
{% endhighlight %}
