One of my greatest passions is astronomy. I have owned a  telescope since 2004, and more recently upgraded my telescope to a bigger model.
Living in the Netherlands makes obervational astronomy pretty hard, since light pollution is very severe pretty much everywhere, and the weather certainly does not like to play along, but there are the occasional good nights. 

My main equipment is a SkyWatcher 250PDS Explorer 8" Newtonian reflector, on a sturdy HEQ-5 motorised equatorial mount. 
My imaging is done with a ZWO ASI120MM monochrome video camera with an IRGB filter set.
