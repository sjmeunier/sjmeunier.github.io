Living in the Netherlands is not ideal for astronomy with the high levels of light pollution covering the whole country, and not to mention the frequently cloudy weather. I miss having the dark South African skies. 

I got my first telescope, a 4" Meade reflector, in 2004, and have recently upgraded to a Sky Watcher 250PDS 8" Newtonian reflector mounted on a HEQ-5 motorised equatorial mount.

My main camera is a ZWO ASI120MM monochrome video camera, with an IRGB filter set.
