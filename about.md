I'm a software developer, working as a .NET web development. I am also well-versed in Java, ElasicSearch, Hadoop and JavaScript, amongst others. 

I am also very passionate about astronomy and genealogy when not thinking about coding. 

I live in the Netherlands with my wife and son, and am originally from South Africa.
