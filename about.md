I work as a .NET web developer, but am also well-versed in Java, ElasicSearch, Hadoop and JavaScript, amongst others. 

I am also very passionate about astronomy and genealogy when not thinking about coding. 

I have been living in the Netherlands for the past 6 years, with my wife and son, and am originally from South Africa.
