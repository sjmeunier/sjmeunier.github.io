title: The Whisky Diaries
---

I love single malt whiskies but tend to only drink them when I have a fellow whisky drinker over, and so after a while I forget what some of the bottles in my collection taste like. To overcome this problem, I have started The Whisky Diaries to document my experiences with the various bottles in my collection. Sit back, and welcome to the ride.
